## tl;dr
 - Takeaway 1
 - Takeaway 2
 - Open question or critique

generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora

efficient approximate inference technique based on variational methods and EM for empirical Bayes parameter estimation

tf-idf is appealing for basic identification of sets of words

latent semantic indexing (LSI): singular value decomposition of X matrix to find linear subspace in tf-idf features that captures most of variance, linear combinations of original tf-idf features

probabilistic LSI (pLSI) model: each word is a sample from mixture models of topics, no probabilistic model at the level of documents

exchangeability: conditionally independent (with respect to latent parameter)and identifically distributed

## Section 1
 - Something witty or just summarizing
 - Easy to read to remembmer what was in this paper

## Section 2
 - Elaborate on something else
 - What are the main contributions?
 - Point to relevant long parts of paper that are unable to be summarized

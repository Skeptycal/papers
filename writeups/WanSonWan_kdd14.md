TODO in paragraph form

## Section 1
 - Quick scan of main details: section titles, references you recognize, gist of paper
 - Reviewers will probably only take one pass
 - 'Graph abstract' can summarize entire paper in one graph/chart
 - Should be able to answer 5 C's: category, context, correctness, contributions, clarity

## Section 2
 - Take about an hour
 - Ignore details like proofs
 - Should be able to summarize paper with evidence to someone else

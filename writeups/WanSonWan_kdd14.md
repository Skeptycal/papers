# Unsupervised Learning of Disease Progression Models

X. Wang, D. Sontag, F. Wang. [Unsupervised Learning of Disease Progression Models.](http://cs.nyu.edu/~dsontag/papers/WanSonWan_kdd14.pdf) ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), Aug. 2014.

## tl;dr
 - Paper proposes 3-layer model that learns diease progression
 - Layers include Markov Jump Process (continuous disease state transitions), Markov Chain (comorbidities), and noisy-or Bayesian network (observed clinical evidence and comorbidities).

## Overall Thoughts
Honestly, I'm glad I picked this as a first paper for 2017, but what a theoretical mind-twister! Had to read several times to understand anything, and I imagine that'll continue.

## Section 1
 - Quick scan of main details: section titles, references you recognize, gist of paper
 - Reviewers will probably only take one pass
 - 'Graph abstract' can summarize entire paper in one graph/chart
 - Should be able to answer 5 C's: category, context, correctness, contributions, clarity

## Section 2
 - Take about an hour
 - Ignore details like proofs
 - Should be able to summarize paper with evidence to someone else

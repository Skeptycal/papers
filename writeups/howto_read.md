# How to Read a Paper

S. Keshav

## tl;dr
 - Make three passes of increasing detail
 - All passes have a satisfaction threshold


## Pass 1
 - Quick scan of main details: section titles, references you recognize, gist of paper
 - Reviewers will probably only take one pass
 - 'Graph abstract' can summarize entire paper in one graph/chart
 - Should be able to answer 5 C's: category, context, correctness, contributions, clarity

## Pass 2
 - Take about an hour
 - Ignore details like proofs
 - Should be able to summarize paper with evidence to someone else

## Pass 3
 - Hours for beginners, 1-2 hours for experienced readers
 - Reimplement / reprove paper
 - Should be able to point out assumptions, missing citations, follow-up questions, and potential issues

## Literature Survey
 - Use search enginer (e.g. Google Scholar) to find 3-5 highly cited papers in field. If survey paper found, you're done
 - Otherwise do breadth-first search based on shared references of selected papers, top conferences that referenced authors publish in, and conference proceedings

## Q's for author
 - How specific should we be about reproving and reimplementing?
 - Any examples of academic papers and public feedback? Would be helpful to train the eye.

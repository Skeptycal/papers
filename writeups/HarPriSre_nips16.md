## Overall Thoughts
What is this paper showing? What are the contributions? What kind of paper is it: theoretical, applied, something in the middle? Where does it fit into the prior body of work?

In particular, it does not evaluate the features in X nor the functional form of the predictor Y_hat(X) nor how it was derived.

![Equalized odds](../img/HarPriSre_nips16/obj.png)

Equal true positive rates and false negative rates across A = 0 and A = 1.

However, equalized odds enforces that the accuracy is equally
high in all demographics, punishing models that perform well only on the majority.
